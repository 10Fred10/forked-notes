The esp8266 is a chip, it usually sits on a board.

The chip itself uses 3.3v, but if the board has a usb port, then it knows that usb comes with a 5v supply, so it probably has a regulator built-in to convert the 5v to the 3.3v the chip needs.

A phone charger or power bank should work just fine.

While the ESP8266 is often used as a ‘dumb’ Serial-to-WiFi bridge, it’s a very powerful microcontroller on its own.
