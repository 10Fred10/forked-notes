# Linux

Plain text file > Compilation > Binary (.exe) i.e. package. Ubuntu is simply a collection (repository) of pre-compiled packages, running over a kernel (Big pile of software that knows how to make the hardware do stuff).  

**"On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process."** (directory is a file containing names of other files)  

File extensions are meaningless. They are there for the user's sake.

SSH in Virtual Machine needs a port forwarding rule in network settings for the VM. Name `ssh`, host port `3022`, guest port `22`.

`ssh -p 3022 user@127.0.0.1` - SSH to VM locally.  

## Configuration

All config files are located in `/etc/`. They are plain text files.  

Use the `less` program to view configuration files, instead of an editor. Ex. `less /etc/ssh/sshd_config`.  

`/`+`string` - Search inside **less** (case sensitive).  
`q` - Exit.
