What should the server look like vs How to make it that way.  

We configure the state of a server, rather than the installation process with scripts, or god forbid manual installation by typing each command.  

More importantly, it offers built-in monitoring and alerting after deployment, instead of configuring our own for each machine. Ex. Which servers are running which version?  

The configuration scripts serve as documentation compared to reading cryptic bash scripts.
