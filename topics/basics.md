# Install
`dpkg` is a backend for `apt-get` which is a backend for `aptitude` (GUI).
```bash
apt-cache search PACKAGE   # Search packages.  
apt-cache madison PACKAGE  # List versions.  

apt-get update             # Update the packages list.  
apt-get install PACKAGE    # Install specified package.  
apt-get upgrade            # Actually update the packages.  

apt list --installed       # A list of installed packages.  

apt-get remove PACKAGE     # Remove a specified package.  
add-apt-repository REPO    # Add 3rd party repository or PPA (Personal Package Archive).  

curl URL                   # Output the URL content.  
wget "URL"                 # Download from URL.    
sudo dpkg â€“i FILE_NAME     # Install downloaded file.  
```
# Find
```bash
find /                                # List root directory's content.  
find / | grep FILE                    # Search the output.  

sudo find / -iname FOLDER/FILE.ext    # Find case insensitive.  
which PROGRAM                         # Find path to program.
```

# Folders & Files

```bash
# List
ls -a       # List all files, including hidden.  
cat FILE    # Show the file content in terminal.  
less FILE   # View file content in the less program.
head FILE   # Show first 10 lines.
tail FILE   # Show last 10 lines.  

# Create
mkdir FOLDER   # Create a folder.   
touch FILE     # Create a file.

# Copy/Paste
cp PATH/FILE PATH/FILE   # Create a copy.  
mv PATH/FILE PATH/FILE   # Rename or Cut & Paste a file.

# Delete
rm FOLDER/FILE   # Delete folder or file.  
rm -r FOLDER     # Delete a directory and its files.
```

# Processes
```bash
ps -ef                     # List all running processes.  
ps -ef | grep <criteria>   # Find a specific process.  
kill -9 <pid>              # Kill a process by id.  
```

# Add environment PATH variable
PATH is an enviroment variable. It  tells your machine where to search for programs, so when you run your **picc** program you can just do `picc` instead of `/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin/picc`.

```bash
env            # List all variables.  
echo "$HOME"   # Specific variable, in this case **$PATH**.  
```

Paths are delimited with `:`.

```bash
# Method 1
vim ~/.profile # Edit this file.
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" # Find this line.
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH:/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin" # Change it into this.
# It appends the new path to the existing system ones, just for this user.

# Method 2 - Shorthand to avoid editing manually.
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin" # export <VARIABLE>="<VALUE>"
```

# Static server
This will start a static web server on port `8000`. The command has to be run in the directory with the `index.html` file.  
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

# Networking
**Gateway** is the router address we are talking to in order to connect to the rest of the network/internet.  

`127.0.0.1` - Your computer.  
`192.168.x.x` - Local address created by a router.  

`ifconfig` - Check IP address.  
`ping 8.8.8.8` - Ping IP address.  
`netstat -tupln` - Check open ports.

`cat etc/network/interfaces` - Shows the interfaces brought up after booting.  

`/etc/hosts` is used to simulate a domain for an IP address. Add `127.0.0.1 domain.com` to avoid typing the IP address.  


# Password Generator

Generate a random 14 character password by using the linux `/dev/urandom` file, a stream of mashed system data.  

`cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc a-zA-Z0-9 | head -c 14`

# Ubuntu on Windows

`C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\lxss\home\user` - Filesystem location.  

`cd /mnt/` - Navigate to My Computer (C:, D:).
