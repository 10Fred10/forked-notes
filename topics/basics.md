`apt-get update` - Update the packages list.  
`apt-get install PACKAGE` - Install specified package.  
`apt-get upgrade` - Actually update the packages.  

`apt list --installed` - A list of installed packages.  

`apt-get remove PACKAGE` - Remove a specified package.  
`add-apt-repository REPO` - Add 3rd party repository or PPA (Personal Package Archive).  

`curl URL` - Output the URL content.  
`wget "URL"` - Download from URL.    
`sudo dpkg â€“i FILE_NAME` - Install downloaded file.

`find / | grep FILE` - Search the output.  

`sudo find / -iname FOLDER/FILE.ext` - Find case insensitive.  
`which PROGRAM` - Find path to program.

# Folders & Files

## List
`ls -a` - List all files, including hidden.  
`cat FILE` - Show the file's content.  
`head FILE` or `tail FILE` - Show first or last 10 lines.

`mkdir FOLDER` - Create a folder.   
`touch FILE` - Create a file.

`cp PATH/FILE PATH/FILE` - Create a copy.  
`mv PATH/FILE PATH/FILE` - Rename or Cut & Paste a file.

## Delete
`rm FOLDER/FILE` - Delete folder or file.  
`rm -r FOLDER` - Delete a directory and its files.

# Processes
`ps -ef` - List all running processes.  
`ps -ef | grep <criteria>` - Find a specific process.  

`kill -9 <pid>` - Kill a process by id.  

# Add environment PATH variable
PATH is an enviroment variable. It  tells your machine where to search for programs, so when you run your **picc** program you can just do `picc` instead of `/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin/picc`.

`env` - List all variables.  
`echo "$HOME"` - Specific variable, in this case **$PATH**.  

Paths are delimited with `:`.

```bash
# Method 1
vim ~/.profile # Edit this file.
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" # Find this line.
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH:/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin" # Change it into this.
# It appends the new path to the existing system ones, just for this user.

# Method 2 - Shorthand to avoid editing manually.
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/hitech/picc/9.82/bin" # export <VARIABLE>="<VALUE>"
```

# Networking
**Gateway** is the router address we are talking to in order to connect to the rest of the network/internet.  

`127.0.0.1` - Your computer.  
`192.168.x.x` - Local address created by a router.  

`ifconfig` - Check IP address.  
`ping 8.8.8.8` - Ping IP address.  
`netstat -tupln` - Check open ports.

`cat etc/network/interfaces` - Shows the interfaces brought up after booting.  

`/etc/hosts` is used to simulate a domain for an IP address. Add `127.0.0.1 domain.com` to avoid typing the IP address.  

# Notes
`dpkg` is a backend for `apt-get` which is a backend for `aptitude` (GUI).

# Password Generator

Generate a random 14 character password by using the linux `/dev/urandom` file, a stream of mashed system data.  

`cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc a-zA-Z0-9 | head -c 14`

# Ubuntu on Windows

`C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\lxss\home\user` - Filesystem location.  

`cd /mnt/` - Navigate to My Computer (C:, D:).
