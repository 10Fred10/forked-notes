# Functional Programming

Simple **is not** easy. Simple software is beautiful, and worth the effort.


For `objects`, we add properties with the `...spread` operator, and remove them with `...spread destructuring`.  

For arrays, we add items also with the `...spread` operator, transoform the array with `.map`, and remove items with `.filter`.

In both objects and arrays, we summarize info with `.reduce`.
